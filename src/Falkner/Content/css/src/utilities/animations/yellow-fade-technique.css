/**
 * Spotlight aka the "Yellow Fade Technique"
 *
 * Coined by 37signals to be used to subtly spotlight a recently changed area of a page.
 * Source: https://signalvnoise.com/archives/000558.php
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * <span class="u-spotlight-animation">Pikachu used Flash!</span>
 *
 * Notes:
 * N1. Free up required resources when keyframe is at 100% - https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/issues/537#issuecomment-185738234
 * N2. Due to the CSS Will Change Module Level 1 spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/css-will-change-1/) `will-change` should be applied a short time
 *     before the animation actually starts so in cases where one wants to make use of `will-change` performance then a `u-*--hint` class should
 *     be added in locations where an animation class will be used - https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/issues/537#issuecomment-186105273
 * N3. WARNING - Be-careful using `u-*--hint` classes as it can also be harmful to performance if it is abused or can cause the browser
 *     to crash due to running out of GPU memory - https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/issues/537#issuecomment-286775213
