/**
 * WARNING: scope should be used sparingly - these should be used for a new styling context but may not necessarily cosmetic.
 *
 * Scope can be open to abuse and lead to poor CSS if not used wisely. If you find yourself having to call a certain scope style in multiple locations
 * then it probably should be re-factored and moved outside of scope.
 *
 * Normally what would be used in scope would be things that we don't have control over - such as if we were using some third party content management system
 * another case might be if we are needing to do certain styles that might be considered a 'one-off' or if it's a certain section of the site that needs to
 * be styled a certain way that for certain pages but the markup remains the same with the exception of the class that get's appended which would be used as the
 * scope hook.

/**
 * Number Input Spinner Adjustment
 *
 * Support: Chrome 59+
 * Details: When requested to remove the spinner (up & down arrow) styles from number inputs.
 * Supporting Details: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790935/can-i-hide-the-html5-number-input-s-spin-box/27935448#27935448
 * Additional Details: https://css-tricks.com/numeric-inputs-a-comparison-of-browser-defaults/
 * Workaround: Wrap the number input with the `s-remove-spinners` scope class when it is requested to hide the up and down spin buttons.
 *
 * Notes:
 * N1. Apparently some margin exists even if it's hidden.
