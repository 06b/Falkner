 * Shame.css
 *
 * The idea of shame.css is that you have a totally new stylesheet reserved just for your hacky code. Code you have to write to get the release out on time, but code that makes you ashamed.
 *
 * Hacks are inevitable, we want to make sure everyone is aware of them so it's easy to find and fix things.
 * The goal is to try and keep good code nice and clean - Broken Windows Theory
